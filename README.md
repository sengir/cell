cell
====
A simple (and bad) cellular automata written in C using SDL2 to render the display and handle keyboard input.

A matrix of cells is generated with varying ages and colors. During each update step, any alive cell can attack a neighboring cell of a different color (if # of neighbors > 1), run away (if # of neighbors = 1), or wander (if # of neighbors = 0). Any dead cell can be reborn as the offspring of the two brightest neighboring cells, if the two parents are within mating range color-wise. Each generation, there is a chance of genetic disease occurring, represented by a black square in drawn in the diseased cell. Diseased cells have a significantly shorter lifespan and serve as a measure to deter homogeny (since that's boring). This is also achieved by the color of offspring being a mixture of both parents' colors. This process repeats ad infinitum until you either pause the close the simulation.

Usage
-----
0. Install SDL2 development packages (Ex. `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`)
1. Compile using `make`
2. Run using `./cell <seed> <mate range> <friend range> <disease chance> <offspring color>`. Ex. `./cell 1337 64 32 1 1.1`
3. Use the 'P' key to toggle automatic playback and the spacebar to advance one step

Known Issues
------------
* Since I'm only using one matrix with no buffering, a cell can perform multiple actions in one step if it moves right or down.
* There are no comments in the source, because I'm too lazy. ðŸ˜Ž
* Zero optimization and minimal cleanup was done, so don't be surprised when you see some of the worst C you've ever seen in your life. On the bright side, it is fully ANSI C compliant with rigorous use of `inttypes.h`.
